# Octave machine learning demo

**Program which demonstrates machine learning in Octave.**

You need to install Octave on your computer, here are<br>
some clues:<br>

<b>I'm using:</b>
<pre>el@apollo:/workspace/octave_machine_learning_demo$ octave -v 
GNU Octave, version 3.8.1
</pre>


<b>Run it like this:<br></b>

<pre>
octave logisticTest.m
</pre>

<b>How it works, 10 thousand foot view:<br></b>

It runs the machine learning algorithm described by Sebastian Thrun,<br>
Andrew NG, and Michael Littman and uses those principles to <br>
take a set of feature data and create a neural network which itself<br>
is a map that can guide a user to take unknown inputs and use that<br>
to calculate the final answer.<br>
<br>
<b>Low level details on how/why it works:</b>

<b>Why is this interesting:</b><br>
A similar version of this occurs in humans when babies first learn to <br>
tell the difference between dogs and cats.  Using examples and <br>
contrasting/comparing the differences between one and the other<br>
you can create a spiderweb of nodes and weights to classify <br>
what in the data is signal, and what is noise.  These concepts were<br>
discovered in the 1950's, and used throughout the 1970's through today to <br>
knock over the stock market, make self driving cars, have speech recognition<br>
technology on your phone, and many other applications.<br>
<br>
These machine learning concepts are leaking out into the hoi polloi<br>
and are being used to eliminate jobs where humans do repetitive motion<br>
work requiring only a minimal version of intelligence.<br>
<br>
The next 50 years will be about using these computers to usher in a<br>
post-work society where the machines do the work, and the humans are<br>
there to only specify and define what work is to be done and when to do<br>
it. <br>

<b>If you're young and niave, and want to use this to knock<br>
over the stock market, is this code battle tested and up for the task?</b>
I took this basic example and scaled it up to work on 120 features<br>
on hundreds of thousands of rows, trying to find sustainably exploitable<br>
patterns in the securities markets in order to buy stocks low and sell<br>
them dear.  But alas as you can see, one should not go into a boxing<br>
ring with a prized fighter unless you are prepared to play poker with<br>
the brightest minds on the planet making machine learning algorithms.<br>
<br>
This AI software can be used to time the securities markets, however<br>
you're about 20 years late to the party.  This is already used by<br>
citadel and the hundreds of other hedge funds earning billions of dollars<br>
per year off the backs of the proletariat class who keep money in banks<br>
and the stock market.<br>
<br>
In short, no, fugettahbahdit.  And don't enter the boxing ring with<br>
a prized fighter either, the other learning algorithms are going to<br>
play you like a cheap fiddle and set you up for a fall.
